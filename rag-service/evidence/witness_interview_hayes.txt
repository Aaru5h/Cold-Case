MORRISON: Mrs. Hayes, thank you for speaking with us. How long have you worked for the Thornton family?

HAYES: Fifteen years this December, Detective. Mr. Thornton hired me himself when he first bought the house.

MORRISON: Tell me about the evening of October 15th.

HAYES: It started like any normal evening. I prepared dinner at 6 PM - roast chicken, Mr. Thornton's favorite. But there was tension in the air.

MORRISON: What kind of tension?

HAYES: Mr. Thornton and Mrs. Eleanor had a terrible argument before dinner. I heard shouting from the study. She stormed out, and he locked himself in there. Didn't even come out for dinner.

MORRISON: What were they arguing about?

HAYES: I couldn't hear everything, but I distinctly heard Mrs. Eleanor say "You can't cut James out! He's your only son!" Mr. Thornton shouted back something about "deserving nothing" and "that woman."

MORRISON: "That woman" - do you know who he meant?

HAYES: There were rumors among the staff that young Mr. James had been seeing someone his father disapproved of. A woman named Victoria something. I never met her myself.

MORRISON: What happened after the argument?

HAYES: Mrs. Eleanor went to the garden. She does that when she's upset - tends to her roses even in the rain. I was cleaning up dinner in the kitchen when I heard the crash. That's when Mrs. Eleanor came running in, screaming.

MORRISON: Did you see or hear anyone else in the house?

HAYES: No, but I did see headlights in the driveway around 9 PM. A car pulled up, then left after maybe five minutes. I assumed it was a delivery or someone looking for directions.

MORRISON: Can you describe the car?

HAYES: It was dark and raining hard. I only saw it from the kitchen window. It looked like a dark sedan, maybe blue or black. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
